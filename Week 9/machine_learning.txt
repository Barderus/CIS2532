Machine Learning

-- Rather than programming expertise into our applications,
we program them to learn from data. Lots of it.

Predictions
-- Improve weather forecasting to save lives, minimize injuries
and property damages
-- Improve cancer diagnoses and treatment regimens
-- Detect fraudulent credit-card purchases and insurance claims
--Predict the bets strategies for coaches and players to use to win more games
and championships.

Scikit-Learn (sklearn)

-- Convenietly packages the most effective machine-learning algorithms as estimators
-- They are encapsulted
-- To figure out which model works the best for the project, you gotta run them with different datasets
and pick the best one(s)

Datasets
-- The amount data that's available today is already enormous and continues to grow exponentially.
-- In the past, people would say "I'm drowning on data and I don't know what to do with it.",
now they say "flood me with big data so I can use machine learning and powerful computing capabilities to extract insigts
and make predictions.
-- Repository (openml.org)
-- Data with rows and columns to predict some value
-- Libraries like scikit-learn have the popular datasets to experient with

Types of Machine Learning

-- Can be divided into two main categories: Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning.
There is also semi-supervised and reinforcement learning, but in this chapter, it will not be explored.

    --- Supervised Machine Learning
        Trained labeled data
        The datasets consists of rows and columns.
            Row = sample
            Column = target (dog or cat)
                Target is the value you're trying to predict for new data
        Two categories:
            Classification
                Classification simplest algorithm = k-nearest neighbor.
                    K-nearest neighbor is a lazy learner, they just memorize the training data, and each time
                    there is a need to make a prediction, they search for the nearest neighbor from the whole trainig data,
                    which makes them very slow during predictions.
                It predicts the discrete classes (categories) to which sample belong.

                In Binary classification, the goal is to classify the input data into two mutually exclusive categories.
                The training data is labeled as either true or false, positive or negative, 0 and 1, spam and not spam, etc.

                Multi-classification has at least two mutually exclusive class label, where the goal is to predict which class a given input belongs to.
            Regression
                Regression models predict a continous output, for example, predictiing the salary of a person given their education degree,
                previous work experience, geographical location, and level of seniority.
    -- Unsupervised Machine Learning
        Trained with Unlabeled data
            Clustering algorithms to group unlabeled data that are more similar than any other group of data.

            K-Means clustering algorithm is easily the most popular and widely used algorithm for clustering task.
                Centroid-based algorithm where the user must define the required number of clusters.
