Deep learning is a powerful subet of machine learning.
Resource-intensive deep learning solutions are possible due to:
    * Big data
    * Significant processor power
    * Faster internet speeds
    * Advancements in parallel computing hardware and software

Keras and TensorFlow
    Keras offers a friendly interface to Google's TensorFlow
        Also works with Microsoft CNTK and other

Models
    Deep learning models connect multiple layers
    Keras facilitates experienting with many models to find the best for your application
    More data = better trained deep learning models


Processing power 
    Deep learning can require Significant Processing power
    Training models on big-data can take hours, days, or more

Neural Network
    Artifical neural networks to learning
    Similar to how scientists believe our brains work
